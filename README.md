# Gamelogger w/ Handlebars.js & ORM

Gamelogger is another server-based application deployed within Heroku that utitlizes Node.js, Express,js, Handlebars.js, MySQL, and ORM. I was inspired by my friend Nick who tracks his videogame progressions to make Gamelogger a reality.

### Skills Learned

I learned many things while doing this project with the support of my wife
who is also a very talented programmer and Stack Overflow. Here are some things
I learned and integrated into this project:

- handlebars.js
- Object-relational Mapping _(manually created)_
- express-handlebars (npm package)
- **"PUT"** method

**Also, feel free to refer to the contents within my repository to see how I:**

- seperated the responsibilities within each folder using the MVC design model
- utilized callback functions

### Comments

I found this project to be very difficult. Luckily, a programmer realized this and made sequelize.js because this required alot of thinking. Thankfully, I feel like I now have a very strong grasp on callback functions and utilizing them in future projects.
